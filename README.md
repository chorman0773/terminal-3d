# terminal-3d

A hobby project to create a fairly decent realtime 3D renderer in the terminal.
You can load custom models (as long as they follow the binary STL format) and have them rendered in your linux terminal!
Just download the source code, compile 'main.c' for your machine, then execute with the path to the model you'd like to animate in your terminal.
You can configure the rendering settings by editting the definitions in main.c. Lighting and more configurations to come.
